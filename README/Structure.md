Got it 👍 — you’re asking about **what options/features you should include in your “Digital Signature Verifier” project** so it’s rich enough for learning *and* for grading/demo purposes.

Here’s a structured list of **good options you can add**:

---

## 🔑 Key Management Options

* **Generate New Key Pair** (RSA, maybe selectable size: 2048 / 3072 / 4096 bits).
* **Save/Load Keys** (in PEM format, PKCS#12 keystore, or simple `.pem` files).
* **Display Key Info** (modulus size, fingerprint hash, algorithm).
* **Choose Algorithm** (RSA with SHA-256, optionally allow RSASSA-PSS).

---

## 📄 Document Options

* **Open Document** (any file, text or binary).
* **Show File Metadata** (name, size, last modified).
* **Show Document Hash** (SHA-256 digest in hex).
* **Save Hash to File** (e.g., `file.hash`).

---

## ✍️ Signature Options

* **Sign Document** (with private key).
* **Save Signature** (as `.sig` or Base64 text).
* **Load External Signature** (for verifying files signed by others).
* **Copy Signature to Clipboard** (for easy sharing).
* **Option to Verify Hash Only** (compare document hash vs. signed hash).

---

## ✅ Verification Options

* **Verify Document Against Signature** → shows **VALID / INVALID** result.
* **Verification Report** (file name, hash, signer key fingerprint, result).
* **Multiple Verification Modes**:

    * File + signature file.
    * File + pasted Base64 signature.
    * Drag-and-drop signature/document.

---

## 🖥️ UI/UX Options (JavaFX)

* **Tabbed Layout** (Keys | Documents | Sign | Verify).
* **Clear Visual Feedback** (green “VALID ✅” vs. red “INVALID ❌”).
* **Drag & Drop** support for documents or signature files.
* **History Log** (list of operations with timestamps).
* **Export Report as PDF/Text**.

---

## 🚀 Advanced/Optional Options

* **Support Multiple Hashes** (SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA3).
* **Support Multiple Algorithms** (RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519).
* **Batch Verification** (verify many documents in one go).
* **Certificate Support** (self-signed X.509 certs instead of bare keys).
* **User Profiles** (store multiple key pairs for different users).

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes Reinforced

* Hashing → SHA-256 digest shown to user.
* Public/Private Key Use → Sign vs. Verify workflow.
* Data Integrity → File tampering detection.
* Authenticity → Signature binds signer identity.
* PKI Concepts → Export/import keys, optional certificates.

---

👉 If this is for a **student project/demo**, the **core options** should be:
✔ Generate keys
✔ Open document & show SHA-256
✔ Sign with private key & display signature (Base64)
✔ Save/load signature
✔ Verify with public key → VALID/INVALID

Then, add **one or two advanced options** (like multiple hash algorithms or saving reports) to impress.

Do you want me to design a **feature menu mockup** (like how the UI should look with these options), or just keep it as a list of features for now?
