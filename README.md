# SecureSign - A Digital Signature Verifier üìù

This is a JavaFX application that demonstrates the core concepts of **digital signatures** using the RSA and SHA-256 algorithm. It's a tool for generating key pairs, signing documents, and verifying the authenticity and integrity of those signed documents.

## Key Features

* **Key Generation**: Create and save RSA public and private key pairs.
* **Apply Hashing**: Apply SHA-256 hashing algorithm on original document
* **Document Signing**: Use a private key to generate a digital signature for any file, ensuring its integrity.
* **Signature Verification**: Use the corresponding public key to verify that a signed document has not been tampered with.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple, intuitive JavaFX interface guides the user through the entire process.

## How it Works

The application follows a standard cryptographic workflow. First, the content of a document is passed through a hashing algorithm (**SHA-256**) to create a unique fingerprint. This fingerprint is then encrypted using the sender's **private key** to produce the **digital signature**.

For verification, the receiver independently hashes the document and uses the sender's **public key** to decrypt the digital signature. If the two hashes match, the document is considered authentic and its integrity is confirmed.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Run the Application**:

## Usage

1.  **Generate a Key Pair**: Use the "Generate Key Pair" button to create `private.key` and `public.key` files. Keep your private key safe\!
2. **Hashing Generate**: Select a original readable document and apply SHA-256 hashing algorithm on it and create a`.hash` file 
3. **Sign a Document**: Select a `.hash` file and your private key, then click `Sign Document` to create a `.sig` file.
4. **Verify a Signature**: Select the original document, the `.sig` file, and the public key, then click "Verify Signature" to see the result.
